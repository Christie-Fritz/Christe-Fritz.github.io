# Portfolio

**Hello Everyone,**

**My name is Christie Fritz and this is my  portfolio repository!**

I'm currently taking a certification course at MIT, and during this time I've learned many things just by these past few weeks. This is a 24 week course and I'm currently finishing up week 4, so I have much to learn, but that will help me be able to showcase my skills properly to  my portfolio and  projects.

I'm working on Javascript, HTML, CSS. Learning a whole new language is nerve racking, but also exciting. I can't wait to be able to showcase more of my skills and knowledge.

Thank you for taking the time to read my portfolio. I'll have more updates throughout the weeks.:+1:
